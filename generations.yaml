    description: "The BMW M440i is the performance-oriented variant of the second-generation 4 Series, positioned between the standard 4 Series models and the full M4. Available in coupe (G22), convertible (G23), and Gran Coupe (G26) body styles, it features a 3.0L turbocharged inline-six engine (B58) producing 382 HP and 369 lb-ft of torque. The powertrain includes 48V mild-hybrid technology with an integrated starter-generator providing an additional 11 HP boost for improved efficiency and performance. All M440i models come standard with an eight-speed automatic transmission and xDrive all-wheel drive (rear-wheel drive is available in some markets). Performance is impressive, with 0-60 mph acceleration in approximately 4.3-4.5 seconds depending on body style. The M440i is distinguished from standard 4 Series models by an M Sport exterior package, larger brakes, adaptive M suspension, M Sport differential, and various visual elements including Cerium Grey accents on the kidney grille, mirrors, and exhaust tips. Inside, it features M Sport seats, steering wheel, and trim elements. Despite sharing the controversial large kidney grille design of the standard 4 Series, the M440i has been praised for its balance of performance, refinement, and daily usability, offering much of the capability of the full M4 in a more accessible package."
